# DrawingFun

I had a fun time working on this assignment. Using images as paints was cool.

Resources:

Reading on NSBezierPath at 
https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSBezierPath_Class/index.html

NSGradient
https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSGradient_class/index.html

Question:
Can I use NSGradient with NSImage? I couldn't find a way to use images as colors for NSGradient.
